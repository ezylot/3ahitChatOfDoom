	So... there is a Chat-Client in the HTML fodler. You have to start the chat-server manuelly, by 
	dragging the ws-server_start.php File (which is in the root directory) on the PHP.exe.. If you are using xampp it 
	will be most times C:\xampp\php\php.exe
	If you want to use it, you should change the WEBSOCKET_MASTER_PASSWORD in settings.php ... It's "testpassword" by
	default.
		If you enter this password at the Client as your name  Afeter using the password as your name the server will change your name to "[ADMIN]" and now you are
		able to use a few commands:
		
		/kick <RESOURCE_ID>  	-> 	kicks the specified ID (for example "/kick #12" or "/kick 13" 
									[you can write with or without the #]). You see the RecourceID at the connection
									of the user, or you use the /list command
		/list		  	-> 	Returns you a list of online users in a "<RESOURCE_ID> = <NAME>" - format
